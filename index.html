      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>In 2020 I had to develop an ecommerce website for a client as part of a project. The work included HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. This past year I have been doing an internship at Newsclip Media Monitoring and have built up my skills and knowledge regarding web development technologies. I have gained exposure to AJAX calls, API's, JSON, and JQuery - and have expanded on my HTML5 and Javascript skills. I have built some cool customer-facing user interfaces throughout my career, and look forward to creating even more awesome and engaging interfaces that get better the more I learn and grow.</p>

      <h3>UI & UX Design</h3>
      <p class="design-description">My degree included user interface and user experience design. The topic of Nielson's ten heuristics was a focal point. I matriculated with design as a module, so you can say that I have an eye for design. I strive to make pixel-perfect user interfaces.</p>

      <img class="database" src="images/database.png" alt="">
      <h3>Database Development</h3>
      <p>Database development was an essential subject in my degree and also included an in-depth project that had to be completed. Creating programs that made use of databases was a huge part of my studies. I worked exclusively with MySQL. Throughout my intership I have been learning and using SSMS, and have expanded on my SQL skills, as well as learning TSQL. I have learned a lot about the benefits of properly using stored procedures when it comes to fetching data from a database.</p>

    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="api" src="images/api.png" alt="">
      <h3>API Development</h3>
      <p>I worked a lot with API's during my internship - from interacting with external API's to creating my own. I have written quite a few endpoints and services using C#, alongside LINQ for the database queries. I have also used external API's for reaching certain goals - one of these was using the Linkedin API to enable clients to schedule posts on-platform to be published on Linkedin at specified times.</p>

    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="cicd" src="images/infinite.png" alt="">
      <h3>CI/CD</h3>
      <p>I have an understanding of the CI/CD technologies like Git, Gitlab, and Github. I use these daily to keep my work up-to-date and to adhere with the DevOps cycle. I also learnt about Kubernetes, and Docker - as well as how to write dockerfiles, and gitlab-ci.yml files for automatic deployments to Gitlab.</p>
